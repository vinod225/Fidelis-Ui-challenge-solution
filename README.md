Thanks for sending the code challenge and I used angular for completing the task. Please follow below steps for installing and running the application.

npm install -g @angular/cli (for installing cli globally).
Inside project run npm install (This will add node modules).
Run ng s or ng serve to start the project.
Open browser and use the port number displayed after ng s.
Default redirection to dashbaord is handled.
